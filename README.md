Convert password list to KeePassX xml format

USAGE:
  
  $ gpg -d FOO_Mon_xx.txt.asc | ./convert.rb > result.xml

***** IMPORTANT ********

DONT FORGET TO DELETE DECRYPTED FILES result.xml and
others you may have on fs just sitting...

Having clear text password files around defeats purpose
of encryption and safe transport of files.
